1.**Testing a biological system for linearity and time-invariance:** It
is important for the body to

> keep arterial pressure within narrow limits. If arterial pressure is
> too low, tissue beds will not be adequately perfused with blood. If
> arterial pressure is too high, the tissue beds can be damaged. The
> baroreflex is a mechanism mediated by the autonomic nervous system for
> maintaining arterial pressure. Stretch receptors in the neck sense the
> arterial pressure in the carotid sinus region and relay this
> information to the brain. If the arterial pressure is above/below the
> desired level (i.e., setpoint), the brain responds by
> decreasing/increasing sympathetic nervous outflow to the circulation,
> which decreases/increases cardiac output and total peripheral
> resistance to restore the arterial pressure. The interaction between
> the baroreflex and circulation may be viewed as a negative feedback
> system as show in the figure.

2.**Filtering a biological signal to remove noise:** Action potentials
(commonly referred to as

> spikes) are the electrical language that neurons use to communicate
> with one another. The first experiments to understand the mechanism of
> action potentials were performed on giant squid axons. These
> experiments involved stimulating the channels that control the
> movement of ions across the axon membrane with voltage pulses. The
> investigated ion channels were sodium, potassium and certain leak
> channels that allow the corresponding ions to flow in and out of the
> cell.
>
> A typical cell membrane has a negative resting membrane potential.
> When a voltage stimulus causes the axon to increase its membrane
> potential above a threshold, the sodium channels open causing an
> influx of sodium into the cell and depolarization to a peak potential
> (spiking). During this time, the potassium channels slowly open
> causing expulsion of potassium out of the cell and repolarization to
> the resting membrane potential. The resting, threshold, and peak
> membrane potentials are important parameters for characterizing axons.
> Measurement noise can be a practical problem in detecting these
> parameters.
>
> The file **apdata.mat** contains two computer-simulated giant squid
> axon action potential signals (spike trains) in units of mV and of 200
> msec in duration with a "sampling interval" of 0.0796 msec each. One
> of the signals is artifact-free (vector labeled "clean"), while the
> other signal is contaminated with noise (vector labeled "noisy"). The
> file also includes the corresponding "time" vector for both signals
> (vector labeled "time"). The file **apfilter.mat** contains an impulse
> response for removing noise in the action potential signals while
> retaining information. The impulse response is given at the same
> sampling interval (vector labeled "h"). This discrete-time filter may
> be applied to originally continuous-time spike trains by approximating
> the convolution integral as follows:
>
> 𝑦(𝑡) = ∫−∞ ∞ ℎ(𝜏)𝑥(𝑡 − 𝜏)𝑑𝜏 → 𝑦(𝑛𝑇𝑠) ≈ ∑𝑁−1 𝑘=0ℎ(𝑘𝑇𝑠)𝑥((𝑛 − 𝑘)𝑇𝑠)𝑇𝑠,
